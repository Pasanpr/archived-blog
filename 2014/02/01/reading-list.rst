    Stuff I read on an on-and-off basis.

==============
Reading List
==============

I consider reading an essential part of my learning process. While I
spend a majority of my time hacking away, I devote some (not enough)
time to keeping up on certain blogs and newsletters. This reading is not
just to improve my programming knowledge, but also to learn the lingo
and understand workflows.

Here is a `list <http://www.pasanpremaratne.com/reading/>`__ of all my reading material by topic. Some of these are
updated regularly, some aren't. Some are focused solely on programming,
others aren't. Together they make for a good mix of educational topics
and the lives of software developers.
